Demo:

Step-by-step:
1. Run the terminal from the ReadFile file.
2. Enter your source node in the terminal and press enter.
3. Statistics for the graph are printed in the terminal: the number of nodes, the number of edges, the average degree, and the highest degree.
4. One new window will open - a graph representing the dataset.
5. Enter your target node in the terminal and press enter.
6. A new line will be printed in the terminal: the path of nodes between the source and target nodes.
7. Another new window will open - a graph with an animation demonstrating the path from the source node to the target node.

Example:
Source node: 0
Number of nodes: 14
Number of edges: 14
Average degree: 2.0
Highest degree: 3.0
Target node: 13
Path from 0 to 13: 0, 1, 23, 13
The nodes will flash blue and red in the order the path travels through the listed nodes to get from the source to target nodes.
